					<h3>VulcanCash: Loyalty program with gift card incentive</h3>
					<p>VulcanCash is a easy to use loyaty program just like swagbucks and its like. This trend started
						in 2008 these programs were quite popular back the along with all the other GPT (Get Paid To)
						sites. However this time around it has started to make a slow comeback mostly because most games
						on app store and playstore offer similar experiences and the market is educated about rewards
						and such.</br>
						The reason why its so difficult to market products and webapps like these is because its very
						expensive to actually get things running. Specially since facebook and google ads cost way more
						than $5 just to get a single working client.</p>
