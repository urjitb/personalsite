							<h2>What I do</h2>
							<p>Social Media Marketing and Programming. These are the two things that have always made me curious. Here's a few things I've learned through this curiosity.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>.Net Desktop Apps</h3>
									<p>C# was the first programming language through which I started making tools that were actually useful to me. I still use it sometimes although not much in favor of web and electron. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Electron</h3>
									<p>Despite some of its size related drawbacks I prefer using Electron mostly because I use Linux and its crossplatform abilities are something I really like.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Web Apps</h3>
									<p>I use MongoDB, Express, JQuery and Nodejs for most of my WebApps.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-users"></span>
									<h3>Social Media Marketing</h3>
									<p>I've been doing SMM from quite some time now. Mostly for profit but sometimes for fun. I grew and sold several instragram pages with over 50k in followers and still use other SM platforms to promote some affiliate products.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Automation</h3>
									<p>Nothing feels as exciting as the rush of automating a boring and repetative task. Or, atleast thats what I feel. Whenever I come across any task that feels repetative I always make tools that can make the boring tasks enjoyable.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Scraping Data</h3>
									<p>Scraping useful data is something I need to do semi-regularly for profit reasons. Scraping data is one thing, Scraping useful data is something that really matters.</p>
